# Website Monitor Script

This project contains a Python script (`website_monitor.py`) that automates interactions with the Banque Populaire website. The script uses **PyAutoGUI** to automate browser interactions by locating UI elements based on screenshots.

## Prerequisites (Windows 10)

Before running the script, ensure you have the following installed:

1. **Python 3.x**: Download from [Python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/).
2. **Google Chrome** (or Microsoft Edge): Ensure that your chosen browser is installed.
3. **ChromeDriver/EdgeDriver**: If using Selenium in the future, you may need this.
4. **Pip**: Ensure you have `pip` to manage Python packages (comes pre-installed with Python).
5. **Git** (optional): For cloning the repository.

## Installing Dependencies

To set up the Python environment and install the necessary dependencies:

1. **Clone the repository** (or download the project):
   ```bash
   git clone [git@github.com:NemoIII](https://github.com/NemoIII/bcpe_test.git)
